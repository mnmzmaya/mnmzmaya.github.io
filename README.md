Description: A Valley Christian High School CyberQuest L2 team! Our project is a Smart Plant Monitor.

The Smart Plant Monitor helps you to keep track of your plants health and needs. Many people struggle with figuring out how to take care of their plant. For example, it can be difficult to tell how much water your plant needs, or if it’s getting enough sunlight. With this design, you’ll never have to worry about those problems again.
